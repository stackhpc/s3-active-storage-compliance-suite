# s3-active-storage-compliance-suite

Unit tests and performance benchmarking tools for implementations of the s3-active-storage project

## Outline 

The working plan for this repo is that, since we don't currently have an up-to-date reference implementation which conforms to the recently revised API spec, we will initially mock request responses. These mocks can be replaced with a URL pointing to a functional implementation of the active storage proxy service at a later date.
